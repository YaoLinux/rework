## Why are those ports in this collection ?
#### For some reasons, the port can not be compiled fully automatically with the 'enter-nutyx' script. As this script is trying to compile every ports per level include in a collection. The broken ports have to be remove until it's fixed when possible.

### They can be 3 reasons

   1. The port have a compilation fairule
   2. The port have files in conflits with other files port
   3. The port needs dependencies thats are not in any existing collection
   4. 
   
The reason 1. is quite clear, the port rezept need to be review and adapt to the current version of NuTyX.
The reason 2. is normaly very to fixe. Remove the files in conflits
Ther reason 3. It cannot be integrated in the standard collection
